    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>	The cell cycle can be thought of as the life cycle of a cell. In other words, it is the series of growth and development steps a cell undergoes between its “birth”—formation by the division of a mother cell—and reproduction—division to make two new daughter
				cells.</i></p>
		<p class="w3-justify">A cell is 'cycled' through each phase and from phase to phase by the action of proteins including specific cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). Different cyclins and cdks rise and fall in activity during the cell cycle. Through phosphorylation, Cdks signal the cell that it is ready to pass into the next stage of the cell cycle. Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinases are dependent on cyclins, another class of regulatory proteins. Cyclins bind to Cdks, activating the Cdks to phosphorylate the other molecules.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">	Let’s enter the cell cycle just as a cell forms, by division of its mother cell. What must this newborn cell do next if it wants to go on and divide itself? Preparation for division happens in three steps:</p>

      <p>During G1 phase, also called the first gap phase, the cell grows physically larger, copies organelles, and makes the molecular building blocks it will need in later steps.</p>
      <p>In S phase, the cell synthesizes a complete copy of the DNA in its nucleus. It also duplicates a microtubule-organizing structure called the centrosome. The centrosomes help separate DNA during M phase.</p>
<p> During the second gap phase, or G2, the cell grows more, makes proteins and organelles, and begins to reorganize its contents in preparation for mitosis. G2 phase ends when mitosis begins.</p>
<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Mitosis</i></p><br>
<p>Cell division occurs during M phase, which consists of nuclear division (mitosis) followed by cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis).</p>
<p>stages of mitosis: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase.</p>

If you throw a prepared slide of cells under a microscope, chances are the majority of them will be sitting in interphase, looking relatively inactive and uninteresting. If a cell is not in interphase, it is undergoing mitosis (which is sometimes referred to as “M phase”). Interphase itself is split into three stages G1, S, and G2. In G1 cells simply grows. In the S phase the cell continues growing, and starts duplicating DNA. In the G2 phase growth continues while the cell prepares for mitotic division.</p>

            <p class="w3-opacity"><b>Prophase</b> is where the action begins. As a cell prepares to divide, it enters prophase, in which the nucleoli—spherical structures inside the nucleus that contain RNA and protein—disappear and the chromatin of the nucleus condenses into tightly-packaged chromosomes. Note that because the DNA was duplicated in S-Interphase, each chromosome now contains two copies of the cell’s DNA.

The membrane that surrounds the genetic material of the cell (known as the nuclear envelope) then disappears, and a mitotic spindle is created as the microtubule organization centers (MTOCs) move toward opposite ends of the nucleus. These MTOCs are specialized structures that control the arrangement of a protein called tubulin into long microtubules that can manipulate the positioning of the cell’s genetic material. The mitotic spindle is simply the term for the overall structure of microtubules that guide this material.

As the MTOCs move apart, the microtubules they’ve built increase in length and connect to the centromeres of the chromosomes via a region called the kinetochore. The MTOCs are then capable of moving the chromosomes toward or away from the poles of the cell by shortening or lengthening the microtubules. </p>

				At this stage, the two kinetochores of each chromosome should be attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. Before proceeding to anaphase, the cell will check to make sure that all the chromosomes are at the metaphase plate with their kinetochores
				correctly attached to microtubules. This is called the spindle checkpoint and helps ensure that the sister chromatids will split evenly between the two daughter cells when they separate in the next step. If a chromosome is not properly aligned or
				attached, the cell will halt division until the problem is fixed. </p>

				can “walk” along microtubule tracks and carry a cargo. In mitosis, motor proteins carry chromosomes or other microtubules as they walk. </p>

            <p><I>Cytokinesis is the physical process of cell division, which divides the cytoplasm of a parental cell into two daughter cells. It occurs concurrently with two types of nuclear division called mitosis and meiosis, which occur in animal cells. Mitosis and each of the two meiotic divisions result in the two separate nuclei contained within a single cell. Cytokinesis performs an essential process to separate the cell in half and ensure that one nucleus ends up in each daughter cell. Cytokinesis starts during the nuclear division phase called anaphase and continues through telophase. A ring of protein filaments called the contractile ring forms around the equator of the cell just beneath the plasma membrane. The contractile ring shrinks at the equator of the cell, pinching the plasma membrane inward, and forming what is called a cleavage furrow. Eventually the contractile ring shrinks to the point that there are two separate cells each bound by its own plasma membranes.</p>

          <h2><b>Summary/More info</b></h2>
          <p>Order of cell cycle: Interphase then comes stages of mitosis</p>
          <p>stages of mitosis:
            prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase.</p>
            <h3>Interphase</h3>
          <h5>G1 phase. Metabolic changes prepare the cell for division. At a certain point - the restriction point - the cell is committed to division and moves into the S phase.</h5>
            <h5>S phase. DNA synthesis replicates the genetic material. Each chromosome now consists of two sister chromatids.</h5>
            <h5> G2 phase. Metabolic changes assemble the cytoplasmic materials necessary for mitosis and cytokinesis.</h5>
            <h5>The period between mitotic divisions - that is, G1, S and G2 - is known as interphase.</h5>
            <h5>M phase. A nuclear division (mitosis) followed by a cell division (cytokinesis).</h5>
            <h2><b>Extra credit</b></h2>
            <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>Both mitosis and meiosis are associated with cytokinesis. The end result of both are daughter cells produced from a parent cell. The fundamental sequence of events in mitosis is the same as in meiosis (in meiosis it happens twice). Both processes include the breakdown of the nuclear membrane, the separation of genetic material into two groups, followed by cell division and the reformation of the nuclear membrane in each cells. The processes differ in two fundamental. Meiosis has two rounds of genetic separation and cellular division while mitosis only has one of each. In meiosis homologous chromosomes separate leading to daughter cells that are not genetically identical. In mitosis the daughter cells are identical to the parent as well as to each other.</p>
            <p>Basically, there are two major differences between mitosis and meiosis. First, meiosis involves not one, but two cell divisions. Second, meiosis leads to the production of germ cells, which are cells that give rise to gametes. Germ cells are different from somatic cells in a critical way.</p>
